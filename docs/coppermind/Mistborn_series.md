It is a major part of the [cosmere](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere "Cosmere") sequence and is set mostly on the [planet](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere#Planets "Cosmere") [Scadrial](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Scadrial "Scadrial").

It is most well known as the trilogy of *[Mistborn: The Final Empire](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mistborn:_The_Final_Empire "Mistborn: The Final Empire")*, *[The Well of Ascension](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/The_Well_of_Ascension "The Well of Ascension")* and *[The Hero of Ages](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/The_Hero_of_Ages "The Hero of Ages")*, but there have been additional installments. Brandon originally planned a "trilogy of trilogies" but this has been expanded into a number of series over various eras in the history of Scadrial.

*The Alloy of Law* was initially conceived as one of several short stories Brandon wanted to set between the first and second main trilogies that eventually grew into a full novel, and then a series.[[3]](#cite_note-alloy-3) The Wax and Wayne series is a single four-book series; *The Alloy of Law* stands more-or-less alone while the rest are plotted together like a trilogy.[[4]](#cite_note-Arcanum-9171-4)

Brandon has also said that he may do some more stories before Era 3, set in a 1940's society.[[4]](#cite_note-Arcanum-9171-4)

## Era 3: Ghostbloods Trilogy

**Mistborn: Ghostbloods**, the third trilogy, will be set in the early computer age with 1980s technology. The main character is planned as a Terris woman who is a computer programmer and [Nicroburst](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Nicrosil "Nicrosil"); her brother is also planned to be a character.[[6]](#cite_note-Arcanum-162-6)[[7]](#cite_note-Arcanum-4020-7) [Peter](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Peter_Ahlstrom "Peter Ahlstrom") has described her as a "brown Terris geek girl", though he does point out that this could change by the time the series is actually being written.[[8]](#cite_note-tweet-634012031415271424-8) Brandon backs up this description,[[9]](#cite_note-Arcanum-4927-9) and describes it as a sort of "how nerd culture works on Scadrial."[[10]](#cite_note-Arcanum-8279-10) Brandon had initially planned for the trilogy to feature an Allomancer SWAT team, with a team of Allomancers hired to take out a serial killer, but is now leaning more towards a spy thriller.[[11]](#cite_note-Arcanum-3778-11)[[12]](#cite_note-Arcanum-10146-12) It is planned to be released in the late 2020s.[[13]](#cite_note-Arcanum-16788-13)

He will be writing it in a similar manner to the first trilogy, writing all three books before publishing so that he could properly foreshadow and edit past books.[[14]](#cite_note-Arcanum-14669-14)[[15]](#cite_note-Arcanum-14708-15) He is greatly looking forward to writing book ten.[[16]](#cite_note-Arcanum-3731-16) These will be returning to the length of the Mistborn Era One books.[[17]](#cite_note-Arcanum-13553-17)[[18]](#cite_note-Arcanum-14683-18)[[19]](#cite_note-Arcanum-9042-19)[[20]](#cite_note-Arcanum-304-20)[[21]](#cite_note-Arcanum-13585-21)

It is planned for these books to include a global map of Scadrial.[[22]](#cite_note-Arcanum-15817-22)[[23]](#cite_note-Arcanum-15087-23)[[24]](#cite_note-Arcanum-13162-24) There are short comic books that are planned to be interspersed in them, similar to the broadsheets in Era Two.[[25]](#cite_note-Arcanum-11072-25) There are going to be Allomancy-involved sports,[[26]](#cite_note-Arcanum-8882-26) and various characters are planned to be [Twinborn](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Twinborn "Twinborn") with "really neat combinations."[[27]](#cite_note-Arcanum-1167-27) It is planned to take place fifty to seventy years after Era Two,[[28]](#cite_note-Arcanum-14582-28) by which time the [Southern Scadrians](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Southern_Scadrian "Southern Scadrian") will be well-known to the rest of Scadrial.[[29]](#cite_note-Arcanum-6767-29) It will put more focus upon [Kelsier](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kelsier "Kelsier") and  [Trell](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Trell_(Trellism) "Trell (Trellism)").[[30]](#cite_note-Arcanum-12227-30)[[31]](#cite_note-Arcanum-14641-31)[[32]](#cite_note-Arcanum-9602-32)[[33]](#cite_note-Arcanum-11596-33)[[34]](#cite_note-Arcanum-15584-34) [MeLaan](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/MeLaan "MeLaan") is also expected to play a role.[[35]](#cite_note-Arcanum-4827-35)

## Possible Cyberpunk Mistborn Trilogy

Brandon has interest in writing a "Cyberpunk" Mistborn trilogy between Eras Three and Four.[[36]](#cite_note-Arcanum-1782-36)[[37]](#cite_note-Arcanum-14382-37) Whether he writes it depends on how Era Three plays out[[38]](#cite_note-Arcanum-13556-38) and if he feels he has enough time to write more books before he gets too old.[[39]](#cite_note-Arcanum-4729-39)[[40]](#cite_note-Arcanum-10957-40) The books would be similar in length to Era Two (around 100,000 words)[[21]](#cite_note-Arcanum-13585-21) and be written around the same time as the second half of the Stormlight Archive.[[41]](#cite_note-Arcanum-14801-41) This trilogy would become Era Four and push space age Mistborn to Era Five[[41]](#cite_note-Arcanum-14801-41) and put Mistborn up to a fitting sixteen books.[[42]](#cite_note-Arcanum-16103-42) If a whole trilogy isn’t feasible he wants to at least write a novella.[[43]](#cite_note-Arcanum-13560-43) Nothing about the characters or plot are known but Brandon wants to play with unsealed metalminds as cyberpunk-esque “metallurgic wetware”.[[44]](#cite_note-Arcanum-14739-44) As of 2024, he feels committed to the idea of writing the trilogy, but doesn't promise it with certainty.[[45]](#cite_note-Arcanum-16580-45)

## Era 4: Fourth Mistborn Trilogy

The fourth trilogy is planned to be a space-opera with [Allomancy](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Allomancy "Allomancy")-powered faster-than-light technology.[[46]](#cite_note-Arcanum-9005-46) [Hoid](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hoid "Hoid") is to be a main character in this trilogy.[[47]](#cite_note-Arcanum-436-47) The [Sleepless](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sleepless "Sleepless"), or Dysian Aimians, are planned to have a major role in this trilogy.[[48]](#cite_note-Arcanum-3341-48) The [Iriali](/web/20251230194112/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Iriali "Iriali") are also planned to have a major role.[[49]](#cite_note-Arcanum-12793-49)

There may be two more currently untitled cosmere series written before this trilogy.[[50]](#cite_note-Arcanum-9181-50)

He plans for each Era 4 book to be around the length of a Stormlight book.[[17]](#cite_note-Arcanum-13553-17)
