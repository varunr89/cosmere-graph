**Brandon Sanderson** (born December 19, 1975, middle name Winn) is an American author who describes his genre as "hard fantasy".[[2]](#cite_note-Arcanum-4717-2) A Nebraska native, he currently resides in American Fork, Utah. He earned his Master's degree in Creative Writing in 2004 from Brigham Young University, where he was on the staff of *Leading Edge*, a semi-professional speculative fiction magazine published by the university. He was a college roommate of *Jeopardy!* champion Ken Jennings. He has been nominated twice for the [John W. Campbell Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Campbell_Award_for_Best_New_Writer "wikipedia:John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer"), losing in 2006 to his nemesis John Scalzi.

Sanderson married on July 7, 2006 and is a member of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He served as a missionary for two years in South Korea.

After [Robert Jordan's](/web/20251228191811/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Robert_Jordan "Robert Jordan") death, Brandon Sanderson was selected by [Harriet McDougal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_McDougal "wikipedia:Harriet McDougal") (Robert Jordan's widow) to complete the final book in Jordan's epic fantasy series [The Wheel of Time](/web/20251228191811/https://coppermind.net/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time "The Wheel of Time"). Harriet asked him to complete the series after being deeply impressed by *[Mistborn: The Final Empire](/web/20251228191811/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mistborn:_The_Final_Empire "Mistborn: The Final Empire")*. On March 30, 2009, it was announced that *[A Memory of Light](/web/20251228191811/https://coppermind.net/wiki/A_Memory_of_Light "A Memory of Light")*, originally slated to be the final book in the *Wheel of Time* series, would be split into three volumes: *[The Gathering Storm](/web/20251228191811/https://coppermind.net/wiki/The_Gathering_Storm "The Gathering Storm")*, *[Towers of Midnight](/web/20251228191811/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Towers_of_Midnight "Towers of Midnight")*, and *A Memory of Light*.

Brandon's birthday is celebrated on December 19th as *Koloss Head-Munching Day*.[[3]](#cite_note-tweet-413738065476063232-3)

"WoB" is an acronym that stands for "Words of Brandon." WoBs can be a source of information about his books, writing, etc. that enhance or explain his work, the backstory of characters, etc.[[4]](#cite_note-reddit-Mistborn-33-reply-4) In the past, WoB was found in various corners of the internet, including [Theoryland interview databases](/web/20251228191811/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Theoryland_Interview_Database "Theoryland Interview Database"), Brandon's blog, etc. All WoB is now being gathered (or has been gathered) in one site called [Arcanum](/web/20251228191811/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Arcanum "Arcanum").
