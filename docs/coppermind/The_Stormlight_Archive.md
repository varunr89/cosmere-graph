Set on the planet [Roshar](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Roshar "Roshar"), the series forms a core part of the [cosmere](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere "Cosmere") sequence, and centers around [Odium's](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Odium "Odium") efforts to escape the ties that bind him to the [Rosharan system](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rosharan_system "Rosharan system"). The series is estimated to require ten books to complete.[[1]](#cite_note-Arcanum-2875-1)

## Structure

The novels of *The Stormlight Archive* follow a consistent internal structure. Each is split into five parts, and Brandon plots each novel as if it were an entire trilogy. The names of each part, when put together, form a [ketek](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ketek "Ketek"). Between each part is a set of interludes, set in different points of view, which show events in other locations on Roshar. Each novel has one character who gets multiple interludes, whose interludes effectively form a novella. The books also feature several pieces of in-world art on the endpages and between some chapters, and epigraphs from in-world documents at the start of each non-flashback chapter.[[2]](#cite_note-Arcanum-3718-2)[[3]](#cite_note-Arcanum-3916-3) Each of the first five books begins with a prologue that shows a different character's perspective of the night of the [assassination of Gavilar](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Assassination_of_Gavilar "Assassination of Gavilar") and ends with an epilogue from [Hoid's](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hoid "Hoid") point of view.[[4]](#cite_note-Arcanum-13282-4)[[5]](#cite_note-Arcanum-12260-5) Each novel, with the exception of *[Wind and Truth](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Wind_and_Truth "Wind and Truth")*, also contains an [Ars Arcanum](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ars_Arcanum "Ars Arcanum") after the epilogue.

Each novel will focus on one specific order of the [Knights Radiant](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Knights_Radiant "Knights Radiant") and feature flashbacks from a character tied to that order.[[6]](#cite_note-Arcanum-1673-6)[[7]](#cite_note-Arcanum-11374-7) Brandon has made clear that a character can have flashback point of views, even if they are already dead, so the characters scheduled to have flashbacks in an upcoming book might still die before their book.[[8]](#cite_note-Arcanum-3757-8) The series will be split into two arcs of five books each, with a time gap of about ten years between the two arcs.[[9]](#cite_note-reddit-books-vtua7m-ifa1psd-9) The second arc will be written after [*Mistborn* Era 3](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mistborn_Era_3 "Mistborn Era 3").[[10]](#cite_note-Arcanum-11548-10) Brandon has said he also hopes to write novellas in between at least all the remaining arc one novels, though is unsure if he has enough time.[[11]](#cite_note-Arcanum-13632-11) These novellas would fill in some details and show parts of the story that wouldn't have otherwise been seen.

Subject to the assumption that characters stay associated with their current order and assigning the [Order of Dustbringers](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Order_of_Dustbringers "Order of Dustbringers") to [Shalash's](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Shalash "Shalash") book by process of elimination, the following table summarizes these relationships and the order of books:

Years for the Series Chronology column do not include the prelude, prologues, or flashbacks; years for the Flashback Viewpoint column only include that character's flashback chapters.

Brandon has also talked about wanting to go back and do a novella set between *The Way of Kings* and *Words of Radiance*; he initially thought this novella might focus on [Lopen](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lopen "Lopen"),[[11]](#cite_note-Arcanum-13632-11)[[14]](#cite_note-Arcanum-13754-15) but, after including Lopen in *Dawnshard*, said it would likely be someone else, possibly [Teft](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Teft "Teft").[[16]](#cite_note-Arcanum-14701-17)

### Keteks

For the full list of endnote keteks, see [/Keteks](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive/Keteks "The Stormlight Archive/Keteks").

The titles of the five parts of each book form a [ketek](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ketek "Ketek") which is revealed with context in the endnote of every book. The abbreviations of the first five books also form a palindrome of five parts, being similar in structure to a ketek: (t)WoK - WoR - O - RoW - KoW(t).[[17]](#cite_note-Arcanum-13904-18)

## Trivia

* When Brandon initially wrote [*The Way of Kings* Prime](/web/20251209052438/https://coppermind.net/wiki/The_Way_of_Kings_Prime "The Way of Kings Prime"), he called the series *Dawnshards*.[[20]](#cite_note-The_Way_of_Kings_Prime-preface-21) By the time he pitched it to Tor two years later, he had changed the series name to *Oathshards*.[[21]](#cite_note-Arcanum-13739-22)
